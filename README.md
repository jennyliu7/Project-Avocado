# ProjectAvocado
Avocados. Fruits that contain numerous nutrients and healthy fat, avocados are becoming more and more valuable. For farmers, this increasing trend may create confusion for how to set the prices of avocados. Too high, the avocados will not sell. Too low, the farmer will simply lose money.

This web app provides a simple machine learning algorithm that utilizes a random forest regression to predict the price of an avocado based on various parameters. The code was mostly adapted from the official sci-kit learn documentation.

After completing the model, the website was created using joblib and flask to implement the model in a more user-friendly way. A YouTube tutorial (https://youtu.be/UbCWoMf80PY) was also used as a guide through the steps of implementing the flask site.
